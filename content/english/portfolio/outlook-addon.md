Complete POC allowing to remotely interact with the Divalto Infinity ERP from an email received in any Outlook client (mobile, web, client lourd), through an Outlook Add-on.


This whole system has been realized during my apprenticeship at Divalto, in the context of my CS Engineer studies, as my 2nd year project.

I've published in openSource a cleaned version of the Outlook add-on only, which can be used as a base for any Outlook add-on project.
