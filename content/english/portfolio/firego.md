FireGo is a little Golang API which allows to dynamically create JSON documents with a NoSQL Database perspective.

The API runs on port 5000, and allows you to dynamically create JSON documents in order to constitute kind of a NoSQL Database.

I wrote it to be quite similar to the database service that Google offers with Firebase. It's not as sophiscated, for now.

You can Read / Write / Update documents, more is coming !
