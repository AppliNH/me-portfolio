**[WORK IN PROGRESS]**

Owly is an open-source and self-hostable modern chat-app System project.

The goal is to provide a complete system than anyone can host and run on a VPS or even a Raspberry PI, and benefit securized and efficient chat functionnalities.
This project presents himself as an alternative to WhatsApp or Messenger and will allow users to not have their data being abusively used by big companies.

For that we plan to support many additional functionnalities such as :
- Identity provider, so users who have signed up to a specific instance of Owly can also one-click-sign-in to any other instance of Owly
- 0 Knowledge approach and high encryption, so even the administrator of the Owly instance has nothing to do and can't exploit any data from the databases
- One-click setup and low resources consumption

The project is openSource and still under developement.
