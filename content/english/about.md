Hey and welcome !
My name is Thomas Martin, and I'm a 23 years old freshly graduated French IT engineer.

Despite my age, I have the chance to have cumulated a few years of experience during which I've been hitting my head against a lot of industry-grade concerns around web developement. 

All this, thanks to my 3 years apprenticeship as well as my startup experience : Primitivo ðŸ¦‰
